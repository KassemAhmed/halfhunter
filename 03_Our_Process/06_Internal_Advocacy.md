## What Is Internal Advocacy

The Internal Advocacy process is the way we ensure our work is top grade and that nothing slips through the cracks.

Designers, developers, content strategists, project managers, and clients will all be involved at some stage in the process. Internal Advocacy gives that process structure and makes sure things go through our team *before* they reach the client.

## How Is This Different from Quality Control?

How does Internal Advocacy differ from a more traditional, back-loaded Quality Control process? Two reasons.

1. It happens *throughout the project* instead of in a big chunk at the end, like most "QC" (Quality Control) or "UAT" (User Accessibility Testing) in a traditional agency environment.

2. It requires two way communication between designers and developers, which means solutions can meet in the middle instead of being hacked together by the dev team after the design team has left the building or moved on to another project.

Sometimes, clients have their own QC process. We're always happy to adjust our workflow to fit theirs.

However, that doesn't mean we're not also using our Internal Advocacy process as usual!

## Internal Advocacy Process

So how does it work? You have to action on something in Internal Advocacy, so what do you look for?

### Developers

Developers are usual the first internal advocates. As a developer, you should be:

- Fleshing out your plan for developing the design in question
- Reviewing the design and point out any hidden features, missing animations, or flaws in the design.
- **Making sure the design in question can be developed inside the estimated time.** If it can't, you need to bring it up with your project manager, and work with your designer to find a solution for the conflict.

Apart from reviewing designs, Dev Advocacy time can also be clocked for:

- Fixing our own screwups during the development process
- Self-edification (i.e. catching up on changes to Rails while working on a client project)
- Team building / brainstorming (Developer asks how long something will take, is this animation possible, etc.)

Note that we should **not** be clocking Dev Advocacy time for research, development tests, or feasability studies. These should be clocked as Development, included in the estimate, and billed to the client.

### Designers

Once a page is developed, it's the designer's turn to be the Internal Advocate. As a designer you should be:

- Making sure what has been developed matches the design you created.
- Giving the developer feedback on padding, margins, etc.
- Providing Responsive Adjustment directions, if needed.
- Testing the page on as many devices as humanly possible.
- Providing any missing collateral the developer finds during the process â€” animations and hover states are commonly missed.

## Tracking bugs

We use cards and labels in Trello to track bugs on development projects. There is always a label for "bug" in a Trello project. [Read more about the Trello process](/Tools_&_Apps/Trello).

To add a new bug to Trello, here's the process:

1. Make sure the bug hasn't already been reported.
2. If it's not listed, create a new card for it, add the bug label and add the developer to the card.
3. Add a description and a screenshot, as well as any browser information you think might be relevant.
4. Notify your developer with an @mention in Trello!

Good advocacy is tracked, so be sure you capture every request as a new card, with checklist items to break it down further if needed.

Finally, when a project is over, it gets Archived. Here's the [Archiving Process&#8594;](/Our_Process/Archiving_Process).
