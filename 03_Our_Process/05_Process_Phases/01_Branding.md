The aim of our branding process is simple: craft genuine, creative brands for clients on the same level as larger shops through an iterative process. We do this through active listening, comprehensive research and identity discovery, and ongoing measurement.

## Branding Process Background

Branding projects can take up to 60 hours for a complete exercise.

They follow a 5-step process in 3 phases, except for clients who specifically request Identity-only projects. We do not recommend that clients skip the Discovery phase as it reduces the depth and knowledge used in brand creation.

## Foundation

### Discovery

**Project Core & Research**

*5-10 hours*

Actions: 
- One conversation with client to understand goals of projectâ€”why are we doing this and how will we measure it? 
- 3-5 interviews with stakeholders and/or clients - what are the existing perceptions and impressions re: this brand/product? 
- Competitor analysis - what are other people in this industry doing? 
- Existing marketing/branding analysis - what is the client currently doing and why?
