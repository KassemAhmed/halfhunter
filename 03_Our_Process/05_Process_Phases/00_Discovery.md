## Discovery Sessions

From time to time you’ll be invited to a “Discovery Session,” which is our way of starting the process with clients who have large-scale applications that require more thought than can be normally provided during the [Technical Presales&#8594;](/Our_Process/Technical_Presales) process.

These paid sessions usually last 4-8 hours. Think of them like extended kickoffs for projects. We work closely with the client to merge business and product strategy, and at the end of them we ship our first deliverables.

Clients who go through a Discovery Session aren’t always assured to bring their whole project to us. Oftentimes, they’re about proving ourselves, setting expectations, and helping the client learn to trust our process.

This is our opportunity to show the strategic and senior-level thought we bring to their projects, and position ourselves as their partners.

Think holistically, ask questions, be involved—and enjoy the process!

## People and Roles

There are usually several people involved in a Discovery Session:

- **Creative Director:** James leads sessions overall, guides discussion, and divvies up tasks with the rest of the team. He’s generally been speaking to the client for at least a couple weeks before the session, so he also manages their expectations during the call and talks sales and next steps when called for.
- **Designer(s):** Generally you can expect at least 2 designers in every project. They focus on giving user-based feedback, as well as getting to work with design-based deliverables—usually information architecture and wireframes.
- **Front-end developer:** Usually a developer’s role is low-intensity in terms of deliverables, but is crucial for thinking and understanding the foundation of existing applications or specific functional needs for the project. A developer may also research platform options, dependencies, integration requirements, etc.
- **Project Manager:** Gives thoughts on strategy, comes up with a game plan, starts to scope out the project in the estimate spreadsheet, and takes notes. Also follows up with the client afterwards with action steps, and delivering all deliverables (i.e. notes, wireframes, IA, personas, etc).
- **Backend developers:** Sometimes we have a backend development partner engaged in the conversation if the application needs full-stack development. They usually work with us on the information architecture, and then write user stories for the project.
- **The Client:** The client will always be in these calls. They’ll bring other key people and trusted advisors on to join in the process.

## Pre-Session

Before the session you’ll be sent a Doodle Poll to choose times for the call. Once a time has been selected, an email will be sent to everyone with an itinerary and additional details on the project.

Everyone will also be given a brief on the project in an email from James.

## During Discovery Session

All Discovery sessions are tailored to the client and the project, but generally follow the following format:

### Agenda

1. Personal Introductions. Client talks about their background and history if applicable.
2. Client introduces the project, it’s goals, and their vision of it.
3. Question and answer period with the client
4. Creating personas / understanding users
5. Defining the information architecture
  - Generally this is done in Google Draw so that everyone in the call can collaborate.
6. Designing wireframes
  - Done in whichever tools are most comfortable to the designers, and then presented every so often to the client in InVision.
7. Debrief / discuss next steps

## What Happens Next?

After the Discovery Session, the project will go through our normal technical presales process, and if successfully negotiated will be moved forward and begun. Generally the people who are in the session will be a part of the project, but this depends on scheduling.

## Tips to get the most out of discovery sessions

- Come prepared! These sessions are intensive and require your full concentration.
  - Read... EVERYTHING!
  - Research the competiton and industry on your own
  - Write down lots of questions
  - Get organized 15 minutes BEFORE the call starts
- Be well-rested
- Have snacks and drinks nearby
- Take personal notes
- Don’t be afraid to ask questions, share ideas, and debate with others
- Sketch, work in Photoshop/Balsamiq, start developing, or do whatever makes you productive

## In-Project Discovery Sessions

Sometimes, we’ll budget a Discovery Session for a particular portion of a larger project (Generally these are development related, but it’s not unusual for design scope to expand during a project either!). You’ll recognize that by the word “Discovery” as a line-item in the estimate spreadsheet for that project. i.e. “Pardot Integration Discovery”

Generally, a few hours are set aside to do research and begin work on a that particular item. These aren’t done live like other Discovery Sessions, and can be done when you want.

At the end of this In-Project Discovery Sessions, your goal is two-fold:

- Come out with a complete understanding of the issue at hand.
- **Revise your estimate based on the Discovery.**

The whole purpose of a Discovery from a client’s perspective is to come out with a full understanding of the problem, and a cost estimate to handle it effeciently, so try to provide that kind of value even if you don’t sit down in a call and work with the client directly.
