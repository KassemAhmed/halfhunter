We use an iterative process that's influenced by agile methodologies and formatted for a results-oriented work environment.

We recommend going through these pages in order. But before you do, it's good to get a bit of a breakdown to understand how they're ordered. You can separate our entire process into three clear stages:

## Before the project

However a lead finds us, each project goes through our [Technical Presales](/Our_Process/Technical_Presales) process first, to put together an estimate. Since we usually bill hourly (in retainers), the estimate determines the cost of the project.

## During the project

Once the estimate is approved, we move into the planning phase. A [Kickoff Call](/Our_Process/Kickoff_Calls) is scheduled with the whole team, a Trello board is created for the project, and the paperwork is done by the Ops team in the background.

After the Kickoff Call, we move right into our [Iterative Workflow](/Our_Process/Iterative_Workflow). Whether the project is [Branding](/Our_Process/Process_Phases/Branding), [Print](/Our_Process/Process_Phases/Print), [Content Strategy](/Our_Process/Process_Phases/Content_Strategy), [User Experience](/Our_Process/Process_Phases/User_Experience), [Design](/Our_Process/Process_Phases/Design), or [Development](/Our_Process/Process_Phases/Development), or all of the above, we use the same iterative workflow.

While we're iterating, [Internal Advocacy](/Our_Process/Internal_Advocacy) ensures that the work we're doing is top notch. It makes sure that at least two sets of eyes—a designer's and a developer's—go over the work before it's presented to a client.

## After the project

When a project is over, it gets [Archived](/Our_Process/Archive_Process/).
