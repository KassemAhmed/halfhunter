## Before the kickoff

Come prepared. Here's a general checklist for you to make sure you have everything you need. 

- Read the technical presales card on this project
- Familiarize yourself with the approved estimate and scope of the project
- Get access to the Trello board
- Get access to Dropbox (if there is one)
- Get access to the Harvest project (there definitely should be one)
- For development, get access to any existing Git repos or code base.
- Compile a list of any questions you might have.

Here are a list of common Design and Development questions to get you started:

### Design Questions

- What can you tell me about your company's values and beliefs? 
- What can you tell me about your existing users/customers? If different, what can you tell me about your target users/customers?
- Can you show me a few examples of websites/apps/logos you like and think are well-designed?
- Are you happy with your existing color palette, or shall we make a new one? If we're starting fresh, are there any colors you really like or dislike?
- Will we be designing for multiple screens/devices?
- What are the main goals of our design? (Better conversion, refreshed look, smoother user experience, etc.)
- Do you have any existing creative assets that I might need access to? (Style guides, images, logos, palettes, analytics, etc.)
- Fonts: Do you have fonts? If not, what is your font budget for web fonts?

### Development questions

- Are you using version control? What are you using for version control?
- If the client is not using version control, inform them that we will be using Git and BitBucket for our portion of the project and we will be happy to involve them.
- If the client is using a version control system you are unfamiliar with, alert the client that you will need time (and perhaps assistance) getting set up.
- Will we be able to deploy the project to staging and/or production?
- If so, how will said deployment occur? Inform the client that you will need all kinds of information for deployment, and immediately create a corresponding task in Basecamp with details about what information you need, and assign the task to the client.
- If not, how will deployment occur?
- What browsers do you need to support?
- Who else is working on this project? How can we best facilitate daily communication with them?


## During the kick off

The kick off meeting is almost always your first interaction with your client, so it's a fantastic time to not only ask questions, but get to know the client as a person. It's crucial that you leave this call with not only answers and a better understanding of the project, but also with the beginning of a kickass relationship with your client.
