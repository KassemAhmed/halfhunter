## Iterative Workflow by Stage

The iterative workflow consists of six stages. All tasks, except for some recurring operational tasks, start in **To Do** and end in **Completed**.

*These phases match the setup of every Trello board! You can see it in action on our [Trello training video](http://vimeo.com/118731575) for clients and new Phusers.*

### Operations

Contains ongoing operational tasks like budget and scheduling updates.

### To Do

All new tasks start in **To Do**. Tasks that were reviewed but need another iteration get put back in **To Do** at the top of the list.

### In Progress

Once you begin a task, move the card from **To Do** to **In Progress**. That's how the team knows you've begun work on it.

### Internal Advocacy

Once you finish an iteration, put the card in **Internal Advocacy** and present it to the team for internal feedback. If it's a design task, notify the development advocate. If it's a development task, notify the design advocate. Also notify your creative director and project manager every time, but their feedback is optional.

If the task needs another iteration before presenting it to the client, put it back in **To Do** and repeat the process. When it's ready to ship to the client, advance the task to **Client Acceptance**.

More details about this phase of the workflow can be found on the [Internal Advocacy](/Our_Process/Internal_Advocacy) page.

### Client Acceptance

This is the client feedback and review phase. Notify the team as well as the client with @mentions. Clients provide any feedback needed via [Trello](/Tools_&_Apps/Trello), [InVision](/Tools_&_Apps/InVision), and [Skype](/Tools_&_Apps/Skype) chat/call. If the task needs another iteration, it moves back to **To Do**. If it's been approved by the client, it gets sent to **Completed**.

### Completed

Container for completed/approved tasks.

## Staying in Budget

Ah yes, the quintessential challenge of every project! There are many pros to having all Phusers on a project in direct contact with our clients—increased transparency, heightened collaboration, a better client experience. But there are also cons, one of which is that  more contact can sometimes lead to additional requests and unexpected changes that push us over the original estimate.

To stay in budget, make sure you follow these pointers:

- **Check the initial project estimate spreadsheet often.** This shows how many hours are allotted to each task and what is/isn’t included. If you’re uncertain, ask your Project Manager. For example, if there's no mention of CSS animations in the spreadsheet, being tasked with them should be a red flag!
- **Keep the estimate spreadsheet up to date.** When a new request comes in, work with your project manager to handle it, and make sure it gets added to the spreadsheet properly. Usually an out-of-scope request results in an increase of your budget, or a withdrawal of the request--*but only if it's identified and discussed when it happens.*
- **Overcommunicate.** If you have any questions or concerns, discuss it with your project manager and teammates to determine a solution. From there, the PM can find a way forward with the client that works for everyone.
- **Good Internal Advocacy.** A lot of budget-related issues become apparent during the Internal Advocacy stage of the workflow. This is when a developer will be evaluating a design and making sure it fits into the estimate. If you see issues, bring them up with your project manager and suggest a solution!
