## HR Board

We have a private HR board in Trello where all important HR information is kept.

Naomi keeps important employee details like addresses, phone numbers, emergency contacts, birthdays, t-shirt sizes, etc.
We also keep track of :

- A log of any salary changes and dates that they occur
- Records of quarterly and yearly reviews

Note that we don’t keep banking info, for security purposes. We simply pass it onto our payment services company.

If you want access to the information stored in the HR Board about you, notify Naomi and she’ll make sure to get you everything you need.

## How We Get Paid

Payments come from Cambridge Mercantile Corporation, an international money transfer service. Payments are made on the 1st and 16th of each month. In Canada they are sent via EFT, in the United States they are sent via ACH, and outside of North America they are sent via wire transfer.

Outside of North America there are two choices for how your pay is given to you:

- **Fixed.** With this option, you would be given a specific amount in your preferred currency. This would give you assurance of what you’re getting paid every period. (This is the current way most people have preferred to receive funds.)
- **Flexible.** With this option, the amount you would be given would fluctuate based on the currency conversion rate provided by our payment processor. Essentially with this option, the amount being paid to you wouldn’t change, but the amount you would receive would change based on what it converts to.

The options are revisited twice each year for everyone, just before the 1st of January and just before the 1st of July

Quick answers to a few common questions related to this option:
- Why January 1st and July 1st? Our fiscal year is January 1st to December 31st each year, and those dates (January 1st and July 1st) mark the beginning and half-way point. This allows us to create more accurate forecasts and predictions while still being fair to everyone.
- Where is the conversion rate coming from? All conversion rates used to calculate funds come from our payment processor.
What happens to bonuses / raises given between periods? The amount of the bonus or raise will be added to your baseline amount and calculated based on the choice you had selected. For people who chose “Fixed”, it will calculate the bonus / raise at the point of being given, and apply it on top of the amount already being paid. For people who chose “Flexible”, it would be added to your baseline and therefore calculated for each pay.
