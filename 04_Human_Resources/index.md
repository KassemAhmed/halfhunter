We separate Human Resources into four phases.

## Hiring

We want to work with talented, motivated people. Our hiring process generally goes like this:

1. Select potential candidates.
2. First contact with James about the position. What we do, what responsibilities are, are you interested?
3. Interview: Get to know the candidate and determine culture fit.
4. One-hour test: a quick work session to see what kind of work is produced, and if the candidate understands our process.

## Onboarding

Once someone is hired, we bring them onboard. This is a multi-step process.

## Everyday HR

Who is in charge of what? How do we get paid? Who do you ask if you have more questions?

## Offboarding

And when someone moves on, we also have a process for saying goodbye and making sure the transition goes smoothly.
