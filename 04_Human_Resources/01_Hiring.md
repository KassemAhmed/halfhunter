## Hiring

So we've found someone that caught our interest enough to schedule interview with them? Awesome. This is the fun part. Since their past work and experience checks out, we want to find out if they're actually a culture fit for us.

Our interviews are intended to be more of a conversation than an interview (but you already know that if you're reading this, right?), so don't get nervous. You're just getting to know someone as a person. Remember that the person being interviewed is probably a little nervous, so make them feel comfortable by letting up on the gas, taking things slow, and being the genuine person you are.

Pair-interviewing is a really good idea, so generally there will always be two people in any interview to make sure that there can be discussion afterwards and that there will be two people thinking of questions. One person should be designated to lead the interview. The second person will be there to listen, take mental notes, and ask questions.

### Pre-interview

Before the interview, make sure that you have all information about the interviewee open in front of you,  including their resume (if applicable), any emails they've sent, and the job description/posting they're interviewing for.

Above all else, **make sure you know their name**. They should feel valued and important in this interview. We want to make them feel wanted, and the interview should be a positive experience.

### The Interview Breakdown

Generally our interviews take anywhere from 45 minutes - 1 hour, and they break down like this:

#### Introductions, Thank You, Welcome

*2-5 minutes*

  - *Introductions:* Ask them how their day is going, ask them questions about themselves, and tell a funny story to make them feel comfortable

  - *Thank you and welcome:* Thank them for taking the time to speak with us, tell them we're excited to be speaking with them today.

#### Setting Expectations: Who We Are and What the Position Is

*15 minutes*
  
- *Setting expectations:* All interviews should start with the lead interviewer talking about what the interviewee should expect from our hiring process (which is pretty different than other places).

  - After you lay the groundwork, talk about the background of the company and who we are.

    - We're a small shop of designers and front-end developers spread across Canada, the U.S., and the U.K.
    - We work on websites, interfaces, and brands.
    - We work with entrepreneurs, startups, and large organizations like NASA and international financial institutions.
    - Our team is our family. We love the people we work with, and that's at the core of our process and culture.
    - We created Phuse to be a place for people to come and do work they love, so we've built an environment of respect and transparency to ensure that happens. Our clients value and respect our ideas, and we become their product team. Our team is always pushing each other to be better. It's the relationships we've created that helped us get to where we are today.

- *The position:* Talk frankly about the position, and why we're hiring. Talk about the history of the position (if applicable), and talk about the day in the life of someone in that position. Talk specifically about tasks they would be responsible for, and the type of work they would be doing.

- *The perks:* Generally we have these perks.

  - 30 hour work weeks
  - Work from where you want
  - Open vacation days
  - Education allowance
  - Insurance bonus
  - Office allowance
  - Healthy lifestyle bonus
  - Salary $/how much they would be getting paid

- For part-time or strategic positions, the perks would adjust accordingly.

- *One Hour Test*:

  - For technical positions, each candidate goes through a one-hour test of their skills. Tell them that they will be paid for this time, and that they'll also be given a proper brief that includes what we're be looking for. Of course, an hour is rarely enough time for most projects, so let them know we wouldn't expect them to finish anything, but instead we'd be looking at how they approach the work and communicate what they're doing.

  - *For developers:* If this is a development position, let them know that we would also do a code audit on their work so they can know what sort of things we'd be looking for them to improve on.

  - Once they've completed that 1 hour project successfully, we will slowly bring them onto a client project. If that works out, we'' put them on another, and build their workload toward the full position over time.

  - *For operations positions:* We don't have 1 hour projects for operations positions, but will still bring them on slowly and ramp them up into the full position.

  - It should be noted that for all positions it usually takes 2-4 weeks to ramp up to full-time, to allow both sides to get to know each other and figure out whether the fit is true.

*Now pause and let the interviewee ask any questions they have so far.*

#### The Main Interview

*25-40 minutes* 

- Now the focus is on the interviewee, their history, and their experiences.
  
- Hearing the interviewee talk about their experiences is really important since we don't actually ask for resumes. Once they've explained how they've gotten to the point they are now, ask lots of questions. Try to keep a balance between serious and funâ€”remember, you're still trying to get to know them.

- Some questions if you're stuck or need more to ask:

    - What hardware/software they have and use (including computer and phone)
    
    - What hobbies they have and what they can be found doing outside of work

    - Do they have any pets? Are they a cat/dog person?

    - What is their favorite kind of work?

#### Conclusion and Next Steps

*2-5 minutes*

- Thank them again for their time. Remind them of the timeline for hiring and when they can expect to hear back from us. Let them know to get in touch if they realize they forgot anything or have any questions.

### Post-interview

Right after the interview, make sure to have a conversation with the second person in the pair interview to discuss strengths and weaknesses of the candidate, as well as culture fit.

Keep these notes as you go into other interviews. After all interviews these will be very helpful when you have to compare candidates.

## One Hour Test

If the candidate does well in the interview, they are tasked with a one-hour skills test.

### One Hour Test for Designers
For UX designers, we typically ask them to wireframe a complicated web application. The goal is to see how well they grasp UX conventions and structure for a complex web page.

For brand/print designers, we'll have them do a branding exercise to test their knowledge of concepts and the branding process.

### One Hour Test for Developers
For developers, we give them a single page and have them build it as much as they can in a single hour. Once we have their code, one of our developers will perform a code audit and talk to James about the results.
