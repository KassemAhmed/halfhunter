## Offboarding Process

After a Phuser leaves the team, an offboarding Trello board is created to walk the Ops team through the process of saying goodbye.

[Use this Trello board as the template](https://trello.com/b/OGeC1PZR/template-goodbye-phuser).

Offboarding is hard. It means change for everyone, and that can be scary. No matter where you’re going, we’re happy to have had you for the time we did; and while we’re sad to see you go, we’re also really excited to see where life takes you!

## What you need to know

### Giving notice

If you haven’t given notice yet, notice should be given to James and can be done whichever way you feel most comfortable. He might be really sad and start bawling on the phone with you, but don’t worry—he’ll be all right.

While you might request a call or send a message to give notice, eventually a letter of termination will need to be given to James to make everything official. James or Naomi will guide you through that process. 

The notice stipulated in your contract is 4 weeks, but in most circumstances can be reduced to 2 weeks if it is easy for us to do so. Regardless, once notice has been given James will discuss with Matt to find out the most reasonable timeline for offboarding.

### Knowledge transfer

Generally you’ll have some projects you’re on that you’ll need to help someone else get set up on. While this can generally be expected in your last week of employment with us, we hope you’ll help us out as much as possible by ensuring the following:

1. Any project repos you’ve been working on are updated with everything you’ve worked on. As well, writing readme’s for repos that will need it is helpful for the next person who will be working on the project.
2. Any Dropbox folders are updated with all files and organized accordingly. As well, any PSDs or working files be as clean as possible for the next person to be able to pick up and take next steps.
3. Meeting with any designers/developers/people who will be taking over your projects and making sure they have everything they need to work.
4. While we never expect to need it, we hope that if something is missed or we need help with any of the above, you’ll be able to help us past your last day. (This is usually the case with missing files, passwords, etc.) Should this require any significant work on your part, we’ll be happy to pay you for your effort.

### Exit interview

During your exit interview, we aim to explore your reasons for leaving, identify areas for improvement on all sides, and talk about the adventure ahead. These can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, but are an important part of our offboarding as they allow us to debrief.

### Things to expect

- While you might be with us for up to 4 weeks before leaving, we generally don’t give notice to the team that you’ll be leaving until the week before your last day via Basecamp.
- Your last pay will be delivered on your last day.
- On your last day with us, James will usually request an off-boarding meeting to understand why you’re leaving and help figure out how to avoid losing someone like you again.

### Things we expect

- Mutual respect. This goes both ways. Mutual respect is shown by:
  - Staying positive. While this is something we always strive for, it’s really important to maintain after you’ve resigned. While we’ll be happy for you and your new gig, we hope you’ll help us keep our environment positive for our remaining employees. This means not sharing sentiments like: “I’m so glad to be off a project” or “I can’t wait to be out of here!” While we understand that we all have frustrations and issues with projects/jobs sometimes, sharing that with remaining coworkers doesn’t make anyone feel good.
  - Giving us time to inform clients and prepare. Please do not announce that you’re leaving The Phuse internally or externally before we’ve announced your departure in Basecamp. It generally takes us about a week to come up with a plan to shift your work to another Phuser or find a replacement, and we like waiting until we’ve got it all sorted to share the news. 
  - Maintaining your quality of work up ‘til your last day. You’re still part of the team, after all!
- Honesty. Please tell us why you’re leaving! We want to grow and be the best company we can be, and address any lingering issues if there are any.
