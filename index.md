Hello, fellow Phusers! Welcome to the Phuser Handbook.

The purpose of this handbook is to outline our workflows, establish standards, and create an environment in which we are all productive and happy people.

This is a live document. You can find updates to this handbook, along with tweets and a feed of the Phusers trello board, in the **\#_company** Slack channel.

## How the Phuser Handbook Gets Updated

Our process is always improving, so these documents will be updated regularly. We want the team to be involved in the decisions that eventually make their way into the handbook, so we have some guidelines about how you can affect change:

1. If you have a **big change** you want to discuss with the team, start a trello card in the Process column of the [> Phusers board](https://trello.com/b/r35f4LdH/phusers) and notify Matt & James.
2. If you have a **small change/fix**, make the change directly to [this bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/thephuseteam/phuse-handbook/) and ask Matt to review your change. If needed, he will post an explanation to the team.

## Have Questions?

- If they're about this handbook, marketing, or scheduling ask [Matt](mailto:matt@thephuse.com).
- If they're related to client projects or project management in general, ask [Derek](mailto:derek@thephuse.com).
- If they're about stipends, expenses, or other financial stuff, ask [Naomi](mailto:naomi@thephuse.com).
- If they're about anything else, ask [James](mailto:james@thephuse.com).
