Slack is a real-time chat application for remote teams. Slack is the hub of our company, and all communication that happens on client work or internal projects goes through here.

## Getting Started

We use [Slack](https://slack.com) to communicate internally. You can use Slack on desktop, mobile, and the web.

You should log into Slack any time you're working. As a remote team, signing in to Slack is how we "show up" to work every day.

If someone needs to get ahold of you, Slack will be their first recourse. It’s important to be available to your clients and your teammates. If the app is distracting, turn off some of the notifications (but never turn off @mentions for your name!) or leave the room, but don’t sign off, or we’ll all think you went back to sleep ;)

### Choosing a Username

When you first sign up for Slack, you'll be asked to create a username. People use this feature to notify you when your attention is needed in a channel, i.e. @mattherron or @james. Make sure this is something professional, but also easy to remember. Our preferred format is firstnamelastname (all one word).

### Choosing Your Notification Settings

Slack gives you lots of options for notification settings, so we recommend doing what's best for you, as everyone is different. You can change the notification settings on a channel by channel basis by clicking the dropdown next to the channel name, and then 'Channel Notifications Preferences':

## Internal Channels

We have several internal channels we use to keep team discussion organized. Each internal channel is prefaced with an underscore (i.e. \#_phusers) so that it appears at the top of the list.

Here's a list of internal channels and what they're used for:

- **\#_company**: All company updates and serious company-related discussion goes in this channel. Handbook updates, Phusers Trello board updates, and tweets to and from @thephuse are pulled into this channel using various integrations.
- **\#_entertainment**: This room is for entertainment: video games, tv shows, movies, etc. Have fun!
- **\#_hrapp**: One of our internal projects is an HR App we're developing. That project is discussed here.
- **\#_marketing**: Marketing chat for the company goes in this channel. Everything from social media strategy, to advertising, to analytics, to content marketing is discussed here.
- **\#_phusers**: This is our water cooler chat room. Talk about whatever you want to, as long as it's Safe For Work. Have fun!
- **\#_polarbear**: A codename for our website, [thephuse.com](http://thephuse.com), Polar Bear has its own Trello board and any discussion related to it goes in this channel.
- **\#_rfps**: Any RFPs we submit to will be discussed in this room. Updates from the RFPs Trello board get pulled into this channel.
- **\#_teamdesign**: Any design chat not directly related to a specific project can be discussed in here. It is also the hub of the weekly Design Audits.
- **\#_teamdev**: Any development chat not directly related to a specific project can be discussed in here. System ops, dev process, tools, questions, support, code audits, etc. It is also the hub of the weekly Development Standups.
- **\#_teamops**: Any operations chat not directly related to a specific project can be discussed in here. Process, set up, management, HR, etc. It is also the hub of any ongoing Operations projects.
- **\#_techpresales**: Any quotes for new projects can be discussed in this channel. Updates from the Technical Presales Trello board also get pulled in here.

## Client Project Channels

Each client project gets its own dedicated channel. People can be invited as needed, but generally only the people assigned to the project will stick around.

Once a project is organized, we'll also use the Trello integration so that updates from the Trello board for that project get pulled into the channel, making them more visible and cutting down on the need for email notifications.

Trello integration is currently the only integration needed for a client project channel in Slack.

## Other Slacks for Partners or Clients

Sometimes, a partner or client of ours has their own Slack. You may be invited to collaborate in their channels, perhaps because one already exists or they want all communication related to their project in their own logs. Totally fine! Slack adds a switcher to your app, so it's easy to jump back and forth.

## Bitbucket / GitHub Integration for Commit Messages

We integrate all commit messages, for both internal and client projects, into \#_teamdev. This allows us to keep all of the commits in the same place for the purpose of Code Audits as well as for the Dev team to keep an eye on what's going on.

Developers set up integrations for their commit messages after a repo has been created for that project.

## Gifbot and More Fun with Commands

We have a few other fun toys in Slack, such as the \#gif or /giphy commands. Type in `#gif keyword` or `/giphy keyword` to find and pull in a random gif based on your keyword choice.

There are also a few Easter Eggs programmed into Slackbot. See if you can find them all!

We're always open to fun new ways to use Slack. If you have an idea, ping [Matt](mailto:matt@thephuse.com)!
