Vault is our secure password archiving tool. All passwords for client sites, company-wide tools & accounts, and your personal passwords should be kept in Vault.

## Getting Started

We'll invite you to Vault once your [email](/Tools_&_Apps/Email) has been set up, and add you to the correct user group.

**Remember your passphrase. It cannot be retrieved if you forget it!**

## Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) is enforced for all users on our Vault account. That means you have to use Google authenticate, or your cell phone (code sent via SMS) to verify your identity each time you sign in to Vault.

## Chrome Extension

We also recommend you use the Chrome extension, to make your life a little bit easier and your passwords a little easier to find. The Vault Chrome extension also allows one-click login. :)

## User Groups and Sharing

Each Phuser is assigned to a user group in vault that matches the "groups" we have on the team, namely Designers, Developers, and TeamOps.

When adding a new "secret" (a password; more on that below) to Vault, you must also choose who to share it with. All client secrets should be shared across the whole company so that anyone who needs them can find and access them in a timely manner.

You may also share a secret with a single person, or with one or more groups.

## Secrets, Chambers, and Tags

Passwords are known as "Secrets" in Vault, which are organized into "Chambers." They are also tagged with... well, "tags."

The way we organize things, each client gets their own Chamber. This keeps all client info together in one safe place.

We also have a Chamber for random tools and accounts (from social media to [BrowserStack](/Tools_&_Apps/BrowserStack)) called "Things we Use" and another for all our own websites called "Phuse."

Tags are optional.

## Use Secure Passwords

Always use secure passwords! Never use the same password if you can help it. Vault is here to help you manage all those passwords. Even better, it has a Password Generator function which appears as a key next to the password field when you add a new secret. Use it!
