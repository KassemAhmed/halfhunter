We use Google Drive to share documents across the company and among project teams. We use it for estimates, budget updates, content strategy, notes, IA diagrams, and more!

## Getting Started
Once you sign up for a Google Drive account, there's a little more work to do to get easy access to all our shared documents:

1. Set up your Google Drive account using your @thephuse.com email.
2. Make a folder called **Phuse** in your **My Drive** folder, to stay better organized:

  ![Drive setup 01](/img/screenshots/drive_setup_01.png)

3. Add the shared folders (links below) that we use across the company by clicking the link to each folder, and pressing the blue "Add to Drive" button on the top right of the next page:

  ![Drive setup 02](/img/screenshots/drive_setup_02.png)

4. Put all the folders you added inside **Phuse**.

\* Please add *all* of the folders to your drive. It's better to have and not need the folders than need and not have them. Keeping them under a non-shared folder called **Phuse** in Google Drive will help cut down on clutter. See this screenshot of suggested file tree structure: 

  ![Drive setup 03](/img/screenshots/drive_setup_03.png)

** This is the only folder that is and will remain View Only for most people at The Phuse, as only the operations team generates new contracts. Every other folder should be viewable and editable by all members of The Phuse group. 

## Client Project Docs

All client projects are organized by client name inside the **Client Projects** folder mentioned above.

We store all sorts of docs in these folders, such as budget updates, kickoff notes, IA diagrams, content and copy, keywords and research, user personas, etc.

No photoshop files or images are kept in Google Drive. Those go in [Dropbox](/Tools_&_Apps/Dropbox).

## Estimate Spreadsheets

Estimate spreadsheets are located inside the Proposals folder listed above. Everyone pitches in to creating estimates for new project proposals. Read about [Technical Presales](/Our_Process/Technical_Presales/) in the next section.

## Paperwork and proposals (MSA/SOW)

Paperwork and proposals for new projects are also stored in Google Drive. These are always visible across the team, but only the Ops team has access to edit them.

Next we get a bit technical with [Git&#8594;](/Tools_&_Apps/Git)!
