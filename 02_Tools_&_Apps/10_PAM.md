PAM, or Phuse Activity Monitor, is an open-source backbone app we made to display hours and billable percentages across the entire company using data from Harvest. See how everyone else on the team is doing on their hours, and how the company is doing on our weekly goals!

## Getting Started

Simply go to [pam.phuse.ca](http://pam.phuse.ca) and approve the oAuth login.

## How we calculate weekly goals

Since we bill hourly, our revenue goals are tied directly to the number of billable hours we invoice in a given year.

Currently, we have 13 people working at Phuse, of which **9 people** serve in full-time billable roles. To meet our profit and revenue goals for the year, we need to average **153 billable hours per week**, or 19 billable hours per billable role per week.

If we meet this goal, we'll make a profit of 10%, or almost $80k at the end of next year.
