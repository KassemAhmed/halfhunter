Trello is our preferred project management tool, and the hub of every  project. We also use it to track our yearly goals as a company, post important memos, and have discussions around new processes.

## Getting Started

### Trello Training Video

Derek created a Trello training video for new folks. [Watch it on our Vimeo channel.](http://vimeo.com/118731575) This is the same video we present to clients who are new to using Trello, so it's a great jumping off point.

### Choosing a Username

When you first sign up for Trello, you'll be asked to create a username. People use this feature to notify you when your attention is needed on a card, i.e. @mattherron or @jamescosta. Make sure this is something professional, but also easy to remember. Our preferred format is firstnamelastname (all one word).

### Choosing Your Notification Settings

Trello gives three options for notification settings.

I have mine on 'Periodically' right now. Our preferred settings are Periodically or Instantly. Never say 'Never,' you'll be sure to miss important notices!

### Internal Projects

We manage both internal and client projects in Trello. You can always tell if something is an internal project because its name is prepended with a greater than sign. For example, [> Phusers](https://trello.com/b/r35f4LdH/phusers).

When you join the team, you'll be granted access to the following internal projects (descriptions included below)

- Hello / Your Name - Onboarding projects for new Phusers. Only the new Phuser and the needed Operations people have access.
- [> Phusers](https://trello.com/b/r35f4LdH/phusers) - Company related information, news, updates, team meeting notes, and memos.
- [> Technical Presales](https://trello.com/b/VDLFPRpQ/technical-presales) - Where we create estimates for potential new projects.
- [> RFPs](https://trello.com/b/xBmalmLL/rfps) - Where we put together proposals for RFPs. An extension of Technical Presales.
- [> Dev Team](https://trello.com/b/wEsCZXJ1/dev-team) (if you're a developer) - System operations and code audits.

We usually have 5-6 other internal projects on the go at any one time!

###  Client Projects

You will also be invited to client projects! We have had up to 35 active projects at one time, but you won't have access to all of them. Too much chatter can be distracting. To encourage a tighter focus, you'll only be invited to your assigned client projects.

New Phusers start with one mentor project (for learning the process) and one client project (for diving right in).

Most designers and developers work on 1-2 client projects at a time.

### Naming Conventions

In addition to prepending a ">" to the start of internal projects, we follow these naming conventions for multiple projects:

- \> Internal Project
- Project Name
- Client Name - Project Name (if there are multiple projects for 1 client)

## Templates

Our projects are usually created from templates that are shared among the Ops team. Our client project template looks a little something like this:

![Client Project Template](/img/screenshots/client_project_template.png)

The templated tasks have icons and brand colors so they're easy to recognize, and give a better feel to the project board. We use a recycling arrow icon for the recurring tasks, and the project management-related and setup tasks have a gear icon.

[Derek](mailto:derek@phuse.ca) manages the client project template. Ping him if you have any questions or feedback!

## Iterative Workflow (Trello Columns)

For the most part, every project follows the same [iterative workflow](/Our_Process/Iterative_Workflow), which you'll read about in more detail in [Our Process](/Our_Process).

For now, what's important to know is that the columns in Trello represent the stages of the iterative workflow. Generally, columns move from left (**To Do**) to right (**Completed**). The **Operations** column to the far left is for fixed recurring tasks only.

## Cards
Each item we estimate on in the estimate spreadsheet gets broken down into a Trello card at the beginning of the project (more about estimate spreadsheets in [Technical Presales&#8594;](/Our_Process/Technical_Presales)). More cards may be added throughout the project!

Cards can have subtasks, which can be organized into checklists. **Every page should be broken down into informative subtasks.** As the project progresses, you can add more subtasks or reorganize the ones you have.

## Description
The description should contain a description of the task (obviously), a link to review (i.e. a staging URL or link to [InVision](/Tools_&_Apps/InVision) mockup). Also paste in the URL of any previous cards someone might need to reference. Trello converts the URL to hyperlinks with icons so that you know it's a Trello card.

## Labels
We use labels to quickly identify the type of work that a card represents. The following are currently in use, but may be revised to fit the project:

![Trello Labels](/img/screenshots/trello_labels.png)

## Assignments

**Only** the designer or developer responsible for a card is added to it as the only member in Trello.

## Due Dates

Due dates are set **for the date the task is meant to be completed**. Be sure to give yourself enough time between iterations to have a completed task by the Due Date. If you expect something is going to extend past the due date for any reason, notify your Project Manager as soon as possible.

## Presentations

We'll go over when it's appropriate to have the team review your work internally, and when it's the right time to ship something to the client, in [Our Process](/Our_Process/). For now, a note about how to write successful presentations in Trello.

A good presentation includes:
- Friendly greetings!
- @mentions of the client, project manager, developer, and/or designer
- A progress report on your work
- Any blockers you ran into, and how you solved them
- Any questions you have for the client
- Any relevant links for review (or references to where they can be found)
- Friendly goodbyes!

One final note about the @mentions: be sure to include everyone involved! Too many @mentions are always better than too few.

## Mention

Always be sure to use @Mentions in your presentations and messages. **It's the only way you can guarantee you will reach that person.**

In your presentations, be sure to include everyone on the project, including but not limited to: creative director, project manager, designer, developer, and client(s).
