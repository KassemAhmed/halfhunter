We use Dropbox for Business to share resources, assets and large files across the team, including clients.

## Getting Started

We have a [Dropbox for Business](https://www.dropbox.com/business) account for the whole team. If you have a personal dropbox attached to your own account, it will be kept separate from your Business account.

Two folders get shared across the team:

- **Archive** is where we keep copies of completed projects. We recommend you unsync this folder with your computer before you install the desktop app! It's rather large. See "Unsyncing Settings" below for more details
- **Phusers** is where we keep all our company resources and internal projects.

## Dropbox Rules and Regs

As a remote team, we rely on Dropbox to stay organized, backup our work, and sync the most recent versions all files for everyone.

How can you do your part?

- Save to Dropbox while you're working.
- Make sure your work syncs to the server at the end of each work day.
- Store any important files/resources gathered during a project in Dropbox (and organize it!)

Also, a few common mistakes to avoid:

- Moving files out of Dropbox. This removes them for everyone! (Only copy paste files out of Dropbox.)
- Sharing text docs or spreadsheets in Dropbox. (We use [Google Drive](/Tools_&_Apps/Google_Drive) for collaborative content, text docs, and spreadsheets.)

## Unsync Settings

To unsync a folder from your local machine, navigate to the Account settings in the desktop app.

Click "Change Settings," and then uncheck the box next to the folder you wish to unsync. In this case, I've unsynced **Archives**

## Organizing Dropbox

We share individual top-level folders in Dropbox, one for each client. This folder is shared across the team assigned to that project, including the client. Project managers create the new Dropbox folders.

When a project is complete and a client has no more upcoming work, we unshare the folder and put it in the "Archive" folder. Check out the [Archiving Process here](/Our_Process/Archiving_Process/).
