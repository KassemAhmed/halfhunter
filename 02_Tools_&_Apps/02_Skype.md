We use Skype for kickoff meetings, team meetings, and chatting with clients. For a globally distributed team, Skype is the easiest way to connect with everyone around the globe.

## Team Meetings

We have team meetings in Skype. [Read more about team meetings here&#8594;.](/The_Basics/Team_Meetings).

## Client Project Rooms

At the beginning of a new project, we open a Skype room for the kickoff call.

After the call, everyone stars the Skype room so that it stays visible in your Skype window throughout the project. You can use this room to chat with the client, ask quick questions, and have calls with the team as needed.

Generally, after a kickoff, only the chat is used, but it depends on the project.

## Discovery Sessions

We also do Discovery sessions over Skype. [Read more about Discovery sessions here&#8594;](/Our_Process/Our_Services/Discovery).

## Hangouts

When there are less than 10 people in a call, [Google Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/hangouts) can be a viable alternative for video chats and calls. You can summon a hangout by typing `/hangout` into Slack (remember to integrate it with your @thephuse.com account and not your personal account!)

However, we always use Skype for clients unless they request otherwise, to keep things consistent.
