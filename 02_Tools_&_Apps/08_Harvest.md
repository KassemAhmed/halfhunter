We use Harvest to track time, invoice our clients, and take payments online.

## Getting Started
You'll get an invite to your Phuse email address to get set up. Beyond that, Project Managers and Admins add you to new projects as needed.

Everyone also gets added to four company projects. We usually have two or three more running at any one time, but the main ones are:

- Company
- Marketing
- Phuse Blog
- Polar Bear (Phuse.ca) 

## What to Track

Track everything you do, whether it’s an internal project or client work.

All research, planning, design, development, planning, writing, revising, asking for feedback, and discussions should be tracked. 

In short: If it's work, it gets tracked.

## How to Track

Tasks are categorized as either billable (we're charging a client for it) or nonbillable (considered a cost of doing business), and they're the same categories across all client projects! Only internal projects have custom task names.

If you're unsure where to track your time, ask [Matt](mailto:matt@phuse.ca).

The [Harvest extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/harvest-time-tracker/fbpiglieekigmkeebmeohkelfpjjlaia?hl=en) is a great effort-saver when you're tracking time. Once you install it, you can track time on a Trello card with a single click, and notes will be generated for you. We recommend everyone use it.

### Work Schedule Advice

We highly recommend that you find a consistent schedule that works for you, work regular hours, and take weekends off. Sometimes, though, being consistent can be tough.

- Aim for 6 hours per day, 5 days a week
- Work billable hours first
- Get a good night’s rest
- Eat healthy and exercise
- Spend your time off away from the computer
- Work when you feel productive
- Make work a habit by starting around the same time every day

## Billable vs. Non-Billable Tasks

Billable hours count against our estimates , while non-billable hours do not. The cost of work is wrapped into our hourly rate. However, both types of hours are tracked throughout projects. Here's a breakdown of billable vs. non-billable tasks.

| Task | Non-billable | Billable  |
|------|:-------------|:----------|
|Kickoff Meetings|✓| |
|Project Management|✓| |
|Creative Direction|✓| |
|Design Advocacy|✓| |
|Development Advocacy|✓| |
|Communications (Calls, meetings, Basecamp discussion)| |✓|
|Wireframes| |✓|
|Design| |✓|
|Development| |✓|
|Quality Control (Bug fixes, device testing, revisions, content changes)| |✓|



## Timesheet Reviews

Timesheet reviews are completed once a week to ensure that things are being tracked properly, have thorough documentation, and that everyone meets their hours.

Here's a good example of a day's timesheet:

![Kelley's timesheet](/img/screenshots/kelley_timesheet.png)

What makes this an A+ report? Each segment is broken out neatly, with notes added for context. Jenna also worked nearly 5.5 hours, which we consider a full work day.

## Breaks

It’s OK to take breaks while you’re working. In fact, we encourage you to take a short break once an hour. Get up, stretch, walk around.

If you get up to get another cup of coffee, don’t  stop the clock. If you are away from the computer any longer than a few minutes at a time, though, you should stop the clock. It's not fair to bill the client for any time you're not actually working.

## Event Attendance

Attending a workshop or meetup? Any learning/training portion is trackable under work hours and eligible as an expense. Other components (say, post-workshop drinks) are not. Run event ideas by Matt!

## Budget Reports

While you're working on a project, you can always see a report of it in Harvest's web interface. Navigate to **Reports > Project Budget** and click into your project to see the detailed breakdown, how many hours are left in a project, etc.

If you can't find a budget in Harvest, contact [Naomi](naomi@phuse.ca) and she'll help you find it!

## Filing Expenses

Keep a receipt and upload it in Harvest under the **Timesheets > Expenses** tab. Naomi reimburses expenses once a month on the 15th for the previous month's expenses. There's some more information on stipends and expenses on [The Perks](/The_Basics/The_Perks).

Next we talk about a scheduling app made by Harvest, it's called [Forecast&#8594;](/Tools_&_Apps/Forecast).
