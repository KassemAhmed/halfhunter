BrowserStack is a development tool used to test websites across multiple browsers and devices.

## Getting Started

We all share a single login for BrowserStack, which you can find in Vault.

## Cross-Browser Testing

Anyone can use the tool, but developers use it the most, primarily for testing old desktop browsers and for rooting out specific problems raised by clients using specific browsers (like an old version of Internet Explorer no one has anymore.)

## Mobile Testers Beware

We find that the mobile device testing in BrowserStack is unreliable. When testing mobile websites, use the following tools instead:

- The actual device. If you can't do that, then
- Run a Virtual Machine using something like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
- Xcode has a decent emulator for iOS devices.
