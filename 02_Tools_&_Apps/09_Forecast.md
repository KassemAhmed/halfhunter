We use Forecast to schedule resources, plan projects, and make sure none of our plans conflict with our [Open Vacation policy](/The_Basics/Time_Off).

## Getting Started

You'll be invited to create a Forecast account during the onboarding process Everyone on the team has edit permissions, but the schedule is managed and checked by the Ops team on a daily basis.

## What is Resourcing?

Resourcing is a fancy word describing how we measure our capacity for projects, both billable and non-billable. Forecast is a resourcing tool that gives us a way to tell how many hours, days, and weeks we can schedule for new projects, what gaps need to be filled. It also give us the ability to compare our scheduling to the practical results.

## How to Read the Schedule

The Ops Team uses Forecast to schedule and plan projects, but as a designer or developer you should focus on your own schedule.

- Your goal is to make the hours you actually clock each day match what has been scheduled for you in Forecast.
- When there's a scheduling issue, it's your job to bring it up to [Matt](mailto:matt@phuse.ca), in his capacity as resource manager, so he can work with the team to resolve the issue.
- If you have empty time that needs to be filled, also talk to Matt to find something to fill your time.
- When you you're not sure what to work on, reliable fallbacks are: blog posts, internal projects, education/study, system operations, support the technical sales team, and support other designers/developers.

In any case where Matt is unavailable, contact [James](mailto:james@phuse.ca).


## Making Changes to Schedules

Forecast is managed by people, and none of the scheduling is automated. As such, frequent changes are needed, and the Ops team makes updates daily.

If you see a change needs to be made, you can:

- Make it yourself, and notify Matt afterwards about the changes you made
- Ask Matt to do it by messaging him in Slack!
