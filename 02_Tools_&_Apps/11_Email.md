Link to Gmail: [mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com)

As much as we try to avoid it, sometimes email is necessary. Most of the time we prefer to have conversations in Slack, but sometimes clients will email us support requests. We also use email for official communication that needs to be documented.

## Getting Started

We use [Google Accounts](https://accounts.google.com) for our email. You can log into your account using your @thephuse.com address (*not* @phuse.ca, explained below.), or connect it to your favorite email client.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) is enforced on all Phuse email accounts. You'll be prompted to set it up when you create your account.

### Your Signature

Once you're logged in, please create a signature, using this template:

  **James Costa**

  Creative Director / Phuse

  **w:** www.phuse.ca

  **p:** (416) 578-0850

Substitute with your own name and title. Phone number optional.

### Adding your @phuse.ca alias

Becuase the Google Account is under the old @thephuse.com domain, you must add your @phuse.ca (the preferred default) afterwards. To do that, follow these steps:

PHUSE.CA - GMAIL LINK
How to add your Phuse.ca accounts to your existing Google Apps account: 


1. Log into your thephuse.com gmail account. 

2. Click the gear icon in the top right, and then click “Settings”

7. Click next step

8. You should be returned to a list of your email addresses and your new one should be there. ( you will notice the “Not an alias” tag below the .ca address if you have set it all up correctly.

9. Select “Reply from the same address the message was sent to” below the email address list. This will mean that someone emailing your phuse.com address will not get a response from your phuse.ca account YET!

10. Click the "make default" link next to your phuse.ca address.

11. Change the "When replying to a message" option to “always reply from default address.”

  You will now see a dropdown in your compose window:
