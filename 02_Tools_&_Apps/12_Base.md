Base is the CRM we use for tracking leads and client information, and close deals on new projects.

## Getting Started

Only the Ops team uses and has access to Base, so not everyone will be invited to use it. Nonetheless, the tools is central to our sales process.

We have two logins currently: one for James to enter sales data, and one for the Ops team to generate reports and access data when needed.

## Leads, Contacts, and Deals

Base has three concepts within the system that are connected: Leads, Contacts and Deals.

**Leads** are people who have expressed interest in working with us. They either filled out the project questionnaire on our website or were referred to us by a past client. Not all leads become Contacts (a.k.a. clients).

**Contacts** are good leads that have started the estimate process with us for at least one project. All of our past clients are stored as Contacts on Base, but not all Contacts become clients.

**Deals** are new projects created on behalf of a Contact (not Leads). A Deal moves through our Sales Pipeline until it is either won or lost.

## Sales Pipeline

Our sales pipeline has the following stages. These are the phases and what happens in each.

### Scoping
An estimate spreadsheet is created and the scope of the project is broken out into line items.

### Estimate
Using the [> Technical Presales](https://trello.com/b/VDLFPRpQ/technical-presales) Trello board, Phusers work together to create an estimate for the new project that is as accurate as possible.

### Negotiation/Review
An estimate has been completed and sent off to the client for review. Possible further negotiation, adjustments, etc. The end result is an acceptance or rejection of our proposal. If lost, the deal moves to Lost. If won, the deal moves to Paperwork/Scheduling

### Paperwork / Scheduling
A Contact has accepted our proposal and we move into drawing up the paperwork and scheduling the project into [Forecast](/Tools_&_Apps/Forecast).

### Won
Container for won deals, with success reason.

### Lost
Container for lost deals, with loss reason.
