We use InVision to collect design feedback on wireframes and design mockups. We also use it to LiveShare during design audits and Discovery calls.

## Getting Started

All designers are invited to InVision to set up an account when they're onboarded. Designers have create, edit, and manage permissions on projects.

Developers and project managers get invited to all InVision projects they're working on as collaborators. This gives them editing and commenting permissions.

Clients and other stakeholders give feedback in InVision as reviewers. They can sign up for an account on their own but we don't invite them to join our team on the app, nor do we give them edit permissions as collaborators. See **Collecting Design Feedback** below for details on how to share your work with clients.

## InVision Projects

InVision has unlimited projects, but we try to keep a 1:1 ratio between client projects and Trello boards where possible.

That said, InVision handles web mockups and mobile mockups differently. Where a web and mobile app is being done for a single client, or where you need in-depth responsive mockups, you'll need at least two InVision projects.

Once you've created the project, be sure to invite James, your developer, and your Project Manager to it as collaborators.

### Naming Conventions

We use the same naming conventions for InVision projects that we use for Trello boards:

- \> Internal Project
- Client Project
- Client Name - Project Name (if there are multiple projects for a single client)

**InVision and Trello names should match.** Where they don't match, make InVision match what Trello says.

## Collecting Design Feedback

The primary use of InVision is to collect design feedback from our clients. When you present your work in Trello, you'll include an InVision share link in the description of the Trello card. Also include a link wherever else it might be handy for a reviewer, i.e. on a comment when presenting a new iteration.

Clients leave comments on the InVision mockup using numbered annotations. Most design discussion happens in these comment threads.

**Be sure to bring any changes or new items back to Trello as checklist items.** If a client leaves a development- or content-related question on the mockup, notify your developer or content strategist in Trello and/or Slack!

## LiveShare

We use LiveShare in the design audits, and sometimes in Discovery calls as well. It's a great way to show your thoughts, and let's you draw and markup the screen with a live web-based sketch tool. Think of it like Google Docs for designers!
