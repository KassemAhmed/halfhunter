## Open Vacation Policy

We think vacations are important. The more you get out from behind the screen and into the world to enjoy what else life has to offer, the more positive energy you’ll bring with you when you get back. 

**That's why we have an open vacation policy.** Yes, really!

## How to Request Time Off

To take time off, follow these steps:

1. Request your vacation time to [Matt](matt@phuse.ca) via email or Slack. If Matt is out, direct your request to [James](james@phuse.ca)
  - Vacation time must be requested at least **30 days ahead of time**.
  - For extended vacations that last a week or more, we need a little extra notice—at least 60 days plus approval from James. This is to coordinate scheduling so that deadlines still get met and projects stay on schedule.
2. Once vacation has been approved by Matt/James, add it to Forecast.
3. **Keep everyone in the loop.** Check in before and after your vacation (on Slack or via email) to make sure your Project Manager and teammates are all in the know.
4. Notify your clients two weeks before you leave for a vacation, so they know when you'll be out of the office.
5. Before you leave, set up an informative auto-responder on your @thephuse.com email. Direct them to your Project Manager in the auto-responder, just in case it's an urgent request.

Open vacations are a privilege we all treasure, so please **don't abuse it.** "Open vacation" doesn't mean you can take a year off and get paid, but it does mean that you can travel more than most people with fixed vacations.

We expect all Phusers to keep vacation requests within a reasonable time period. For extended travel periods some discussion will be required to ensure it works for everyone involved. All of our vacation time is subject to approval.

## Billable Hour Goals for Short Weeks

When you’re taking weekdays off on vacation (and it’s not a whole week), each day that you take off is considered 5 hours less for what you’re expected to work. So if you take a Friday off, you're responsible for 20-25 hours that week instead of 25-30.

Not sure how many hours you need to work? Here's a handy guide according to days worked:
- 5-7 days: 25-30 hours
- 4 days: 20-25 hours
- 3 days: 15-20 hours
- 2 days: 10-15 hours
- 1 day: 5-10 hours

## Holidays

Holidays are still considered vacation days at The Phuse. We keep a calendar of Canada, U.S. and U.K holidays, but it can be a challenge to track holidays across multiple countries! **So please book your holiday time via email to [Matt](mailto:matt@thephuse.com) just like you would any vacation day.** (Conversely, if a holiday isn't booked off in Foreacst, we'll assume you're working!)

Again, let your fellow Phusers and clients on active projects know when you'll be away **two weeks in advance** so everyone has plenty of heads up.

For your hours, follow the same guidelines listed above as you would for vacation days. For example, during a week with a holiday Monday, you’d be responsible for 20 billable hours.

## Sick Days

No one enjoys being sick, but it happens to all of us from time to time. We're a team and we'll find a way to cover for you while you rest up and get better. Days like these we're lucky we get to work from home!

### How to Call in Sick

- If you need to take an unbooked day off (you’re sick, you need to take someone to a doctor or vet, your plumbing exploded, or you unexpectedly need the day off for any other reason) **email Naomi and tell her first.**
- In the email, please clarify whether you’re planning on still working the regular 30 hours in the week, or if this will shorten your week.
- Naomi will make sure that your project team gets notified, and record it.
- After you email Naomi, post in Slack and let your teammates know directly. Your project manager is responsible for informing the client.

## Be Respectful

Remember that taking too much time off impacts the whole team, as well as our ability to meet our yearly goals. Be respectful with the time you take off.
