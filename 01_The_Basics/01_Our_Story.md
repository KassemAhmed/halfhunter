## Our History

Phuse started in late 2009 as an extension of freelance work that James was doing for fun with projects for friends and family. James' original concept of the company was a formalization of the type of work he was doing (design + front-end development), and a place to collaborate with friends whose work he respected.

As more clients needed work, Phuse turned into a specialist shop that focused on UI design and front-end development for web applications. We worked closely with backend development teams (both consultancies and internal teams), and as people expressed more interest in our work, we grew.

Phuse grew primarily because of the connections we developed with enthusiastic clients who referred us to their friends and colleagues. They referred us because of our focus on communication, clean code, and iterative processes, all of which are core values central to our team today.

The first full-time Phuser was hired in mid-2011. Near the end of 2012, the first full-time project manager came on board to help handle the increased workload, and by the end of 2014 the team was 13 people.
