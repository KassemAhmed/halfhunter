## State of the Phunion

At the beginning of each quarter, James will post a State of a Phunion discussion in Trello. He talks about the successes of the previous quarter, any troubles we ran into and how we overcame them, and what to expect in the next 3-4 months.

These discussions ensure that everyone is aware of where we are on our Roadmap (first column in the [> Phusers](https://trello.com/b/r35f4LdH/phusers) Trello board!), and the status of any other early-phase initiatives. That way, everyone is aware of the company's direction and has the opportunity to ask questions about where we're going!

## Quarterly Standups

Quarterly stand-ups are quick and casual check-ins with Phusers to see how things are going overall. Your quarterly stand-up is the time to discuss problems or concerns, and to ask James questions about the company’s direction or anything else. (You can also do this throughout the year, but we think a quarterly stand-up helps ensure we stay in touch.)

There’s no formal outline of how these meetings go, but they take 15-30 minutes and are scheduled 1-2 weeks following the State of the Phunion for that quarter.

## Yearly Reviews

One year from your hire date, you’ll have a call with James to discuss how things went over the last year, and what next year looks like for you.

These meetings are really useful for talking through questions and concerns that have been nagging at the back of your mind. They also let us reflect, and think about how we can make next year better than the last.

Real solutions are created in these calls, are taken very seriously, and they get acted on.

Yearly reviews generally last about an hour, but can sometimes take longer if necessary, and can be split into two parts. They are documented so that we can be sure we take action on anything that needs to be done.

You don’t need to prepare for yearly reviews unless you have specific things to mention, but some questions you can expect from yearly reviews are:

- How has the last year gone?
- What was the highlight of your past year (project, event, etc)?
- What was your least favourite part?
- What was your favourite project?
- What was your least favourite project?
- Did you have any problems?
- Do you have any ideas for improvements we can make for you for next year?
- How do you feel Phuse values you and your time?
- What are you looking forward to over the next year?
- What can we do to keep you happy for another year?
- There is always time made for other comments or concerns that you have. These are two-way conversations and we like to keep them open. :)
