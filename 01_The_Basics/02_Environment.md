Phuse has a very non-traditional, but results-oriented working environment. We work 30-hour weeks, enjoy an open vacation policy, and have the flexibility to work wherever we want. We think this makes work seem less like—well, work!

## 30 Hour Work Week

No more overtime. No more burnout. All we ask is 30 hours on the clock. If you clock less than 30 hours, you’ll be getting a ping from Matt!

## 40 Hour Work Week (*Trial Process*)

In 2015 we added an *option* for 40-hour work weeks. This is a chance for designers and developers to make a little extra cash on tight-turnaround projects. Our people benefit, and the client isn't forced to pay a premium for this game-changing extra value.

**Working a 40-hour week will always be optional.**

*(This is a trial process.)*

- Only available for designers and developers.
- If a 40 hour work week is available, you'll be notified and presented the option by a member of the Ops team.
- If accepted, the Ops team notifies Matt to make sure the resourcing works. The rule is that the person working a 40 hour week needs to have a full billable week before and a full billable week after, for this system to make financial sense.
- At that point, the 40 hour week gets put into the schedule.

The bonus pay is $280 base for at least 30 billable hours. Additional hours recorded beyond 30 are compensated at $40/hour to a maximum of 37 billable hours. Whether you work 30-37 or anywhere in between, you're still expected to put in your normal non-billable time, which is at least 3 hours per week for technical presales and internal communications.

## **Over**communication
![I Have People Skills!](/img/handbook-gifs/i_have_people_skills.gif)

We don’t do good communication. **We do incredible communication.**

We have [a suite of tools](/Tools_&_Apps) we use to keep in touch with each other and our clients.

Clients love working with us because we’re hyper-responsive (James holds the record with quickest email response at .3 seconds), and because we are completely transparent in our processes by communicating roadblocks and setting expectations way ahead of time.

Excellent communication is the glue that holds us together.
1. It keeps clients happy, involved and up to date.
3. It ensures that we stay in scope/budget, that we stay on schedule, and that nothing slips through the cracks.
4. It prevents us from getting lonely working at home.

**Want to talk to someone quick?** Give them a call on Skype (if it's a client), ping them on Slack (if it’s another Phuser) or send them an email to set up a time to chat. Don't be shy!

**This definitely applies to clients.** Unless you think the subject might be touchy (ie. dealing with a client request that is out of scope), you don’t have to go through your Project Manager to speak with a client directly. Our clients are a part of the product team too, so don't be afraid to talk to them!

**While 95% of our communication with clients is over Trello and Skype chat**, we need to make sure that if we’re having trouble understanding a client or see that there’s something important that needs to be discussed, we schedule a call as soon as possible with them. 

If you feel it’s something that might get a little touchy, your Project Manager is here for you to make sure both sides are heard and a solution is found. Nothing that's communicated openly and honestly can't be fixed!

## Weekly Goals

Now that you know what we're about, here are a some checks and balances that we use to measure our progress.

- At least 25-30 hours per Phuser per week
- For designers and developers, maintain 80% billable hours
- As a team, we aim for an average of 153 hours per week over the course of the year (9 billable people, 13 total as of 12/17/14)

## Annual Goals

We set milestones throughout the year for the whole company and track our progress in the [> Phusers Trello board](https://trello.com/b/r35f4LdH/phusers). We track revenue goals (which tie directly back into our billable hour goals, above), number of Phusers, raising salaries, adding new benefits, among other things.

James also delivers a quarterly "State of the Phunion" message there. You can always look at Trello and see where we are!

Keeping track of all these moving pieces is our hidden weapon. It enables us to tell when something is off track, diagnose the problem, and come up with a solution that will get us back on track.
