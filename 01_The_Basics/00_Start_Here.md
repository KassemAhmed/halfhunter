## Welcome to the team!

We're stoked to have you. Are you as excited as we are to get started?

At this point, you've already:

- Nailed your interview
- Soared through the test with flying colors
- Signed your contract
- Had your onboarding call with James and Naomi
- Been briefed on your first project

So by now you're probably ready to dive in, right? Here are a few things to get you started:

- Read this handbook in its entirety
- Add an email signature to your @thephuse.com email account
- Set up [all of the apps and tools you will be using](/Tools_&_Apps). (If you haven't seen them already, invites were sent to your Phuse email!)

To continue reading the handbook right now, journey onward to [Our Story&#8594;](/The_Basics/Our_Story).
