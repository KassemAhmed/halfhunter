While writing for [Phuse's Blog](http://thephuse.com/blog) is optional, we'd really like it if you contributed at least once per quarter.

Not only is writing good to help you think through any blockers and explore new ideas, but it gives you a fun way to give back to our community, too.

We try to post once a month, but usually end up posting at least once a week. If you ever have any ideas for blog posts or cool content, chat with [Matt](mailto:matt@thephuse.com)

## Writing Process

- All posts are first written in Google Drive. Everything is kept in the [Phuse Blog folder](https://drive.google.com/a/thephuse.com/folderview?id=0ByXx2WTR7wJDN2I1NzdiNmQtYTIxYi00NDBjLTg0ODYtMmIxMGY0MjQxNmVi&usp=sharing).
- Write a rough draft in a new Doc. Put that doc in the [Post Drafts subfolder](https://drive.google.com/a/thephuse.com/folderview?id=0B_eShU1aMgPCNjJSeVdhaElIcjg&usp=sharing). The doc will be shared automatically across the team.
- Notify Matt that your draft is ready for review!
- Matt will then revise with edits and comments
- Make the revisions, revise with Matt again as needed.
- Put your post in Wordpress. When you do, move your Google Doc to the [In Wordpress subfolder](https://drive.google.com/a/thephuse.com/folderview?id=0ByXx2WTR7wJDbm01V3RyblIxdmM&usp=sharing).

**Follow the instructions below for adding a post to WordPress!**

We also keep a [blog schedule in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/thephuse.com/spreadsheets/d/1nWMdHFSZfiOGDsBprj8xLunVrSWAZMFwOYGgop1OYAM/edit?usp=sharing).

## General Writing Guidelines

If you have any trouble choosing a topic or refining it, your teammates are here for you! Never be afraid to ask for feedback.

## Inspiration

As long as your subject relates to the business or the work you do, the sky's the limit! If you need some inspiration, check the categories we've set up for the blog.

Past posts have been written about:
- Conferences/meetups we've attended and what was inspiring/helpful about them (in fact, this is necessary if you attended and tracked company hours at an event!)
- Special projects we've worked on for clients
- Solutions to common problems in our respective trades 
- Productivity, creativity and workflow tips
- Phuse-related news and developments
