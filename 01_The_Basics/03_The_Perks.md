## Open Vacation Policy

Go away whenever you want, wherever you want, without worrying about how many days you have left.

(We'll talk more about how to take time off in [the next section](/The_Basics/Time_Off).)

## Medical/dental bonus

Because it's tough to arrange group benefits with employees across the globe, each Phuser receives an extra $50 per pay period (that's $1200 a year) to help defray the cost of personal health insurance and health-related expenses. (This is included in your regular pay.)

## Stipends 

But wait, there's more! After 3 months of employment, all Phusers are eligible for our roster of fabulous stipends.

### Education ($1,000 per year)

This stipend applies to classes, courses, conferences, workshops and events that relate to your roles and responsibilities at Phuse.

### Healthy Lifestyle ($250 per year)

We think it's best to get away from the screen and be a bit active every day. This stipend applies to equipment and classes that help keep us moving, such as:

- Gym memberships
- Martial arts classes
- Bicycles
- Yoga classes
- Running shoes

### Home Office ($500 per year)

Gadgets and office space are expensive! Thankfully you can put this stipend toward stuff like:

- Chairs
- Desks
- Computers
- Monitors
- Cables & adapters

### Coworking Space

We believe coworking space provides a lot of added value for your daily happiness. Our HQ Phusers in Toronto have the option to spend some time at [CSI in Toronto](http://socialinnovation.ca/) so that they can work together and be social once in a while. If you're in Toronto we hope you join us!

Others have memberships at coworking spaces in their cities. However, reimbursement for coworking space membership gets approved on a case by case basis. If you're interested in a coworking space in your area, ping [Naomi](naomi@thephuse.com) to see if we can help make it a reasonable expense for you!

### How to Claim Stipends

Send an email to [Naomi](mailto:naomi@thephuse.com), including “Stipend: Category” in the subject line. This will help ensure she never loses track of money owed. Include details about what you purchased, as well as a scanned, emailed or photographed receipt. 

If a reimbursement is needed, those will be included with other expenses on the mid-month pay day following the month that the receipt was submitted.

**Note:** If the amount of money spent is more than the amount allotted in that category, you still need to submit a receipt. We’ll just max that category out. 

**Want to check how much you have remaining for each of your stipends? [Here's a spreadsheet of Stipends for this year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgEWY1279_h1dEdrUjBPWUtUbm9OYl8zNUVfRXpqOFE&usp=sharing).**
