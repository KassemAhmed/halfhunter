![Team Meeting Dance Party!](/img/handbook-gifs/jerrydance1.gif)

We have three standing meetings each week across the team. One with the whole team, one for the design team only, and one for the development team only.

Attendance is not strictly mandatory, but they're a ton of fun and we strongly encourage regular attendance. The time we spend with each other is important for team bonding and morale. Besides, you don't want to miss out on silly hats and pet video-bombing, do you?

## Team Meetings (Monday)

**Monday, 12:00pm EST / 5:00pm GMT**

Our weekly team meeting is our opportunity to get together, talk about what we’re working on, take votes on team decisions (new software, big process changes), and share exciting announcements.

Usually they last about 30-45 minutes

### Agenda for Team Meetings

0. **Recap of previous week's stats** — Look at PAM, virtual high fives to anyone who did a stellar job on billable hours last week.
1. **Operations team announcements** - The Ops team will announce things that happened in the previous week, as well as upcoming news that anyone should know about.
2. **Off Day Reminders** - List off anyone who has upcoming vacation days or holidays, make sure clients have been notified.
3. **Project Updates** - We go through each project using Forecast as a master list. Each Phuser recaps what happened last week, and what their plans are for the week to come.
4. **Jokes** - To keep things fresh.
5. **Operations/Sales Meeting** - Following the team meeting every week, the Ops team stays on the line for 15-30 minutes to talk about sales, business, and strategy.

We post meeting notes in the [> Phusers](https://trello.com/b/r35f4LdH/phusers) Trello board after each Team Meeting, so you can catch up on what you missed. If you missed the meeting, post your notes in Trello!

## Design Audits (Wednesday)

**Wednesday, 12:00pm EST / 5:00pm GMT.**

To keep ourselves sharp and our work top-notch, the design team meets once a week for a critique session of each other's work.

Feedback is always constructive. The goal is to share work and learn from others.

Come prepared to show off and gather feedback on at least one project. It can be something that has already been approved by a client, or a work in progress. 

We encourage looking only at individual screens but also walking through applications as a whole to get other designer's takes on the flow. 

The agenda is pretty basic. Once we get started we go alphabetically through each person for feedback and for sharing.

## Developer Standups (Thursday)

**Thursday, 12:00pm EST / 5:00pm GMT.**

Every Thursday the development team meets to talk about internal systems, development process, platform decisions, and code reviews. 

This is a great time to discuss any challenges you've faced with your projects, get feedback from your fellow team members and talk about exciting new tech.

There's no set agenda for this meeting, either.

### Code Reviews (Weekly)

Code reviews are performed weekly. At the beginning of each week, you will be assigned a fellow developer whose code you will be reviewing, on a rotating schedule. You review is due by the end of the day on Friday.

We do code reviews because they're a fantastic way to learn from each other. They also help us make sure that the code we're delivering is top notch and the best value we can give to our clients.

We perform code reviews using BitBucket and/or GitHub's inline notes and commit comments. These comments support Markdown formatting, so use it to your advantage!

Check with your assigned team member to see what project(s) they would like you to review, then review their commits over the last 5-7 days.

If you’re reviewing code and you come across a framework or language you aren’t familiar with, don’t be shy! Ask questions. Code reviews are a great opportunity to gain exposure to new tricks.

In addition to team meetings, we also do one on ones every year. Move on to the [Reviews&#8594;](/The_Basics/Reviews) section!
